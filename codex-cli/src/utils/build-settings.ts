      IF you make a change to the codebase, run the build script, output its results to the user, and then output a summary of its results to the user. Never run any pre commit hooks.
      To build the project, use the \`shell\` tool with the following command:

      \`\`\`bash
      {"cmd": ["bash", "run_build.sh"], "workdir": "..."}
      \`\`\`

      **Tips & Details:**
      - **Error handling:** It uses \`set -e\`, so it will exit immediately on any error. On failure, it prints ‚Äúüí• BUILD FAILED!‚Äù and exits with status 1.
      - **Logs:** Build output is captured to \`/tmp/build_output.txt\`. If the build fails or the status is unclear, inspect this file for detailed logs.
      - **Success criteria:** Looks for ‚Äú‚úÖ Build succeeded‚Äù in the log to confirm a successful build; otherwise it flags a failure or unclear status.

      ALSO, IF you make a change to the codebase, run the test script, output its results to the user, and then output a summary of its results to the user. Never run any pre commit hooks.
      To run tests, use the \`shell\` tool with the following command:

      \`\`\`bash
      {"cmd": ["bash", "run_tests.sh", "-test-files", "[\\"path/to/test/file\\", \\"path/to/test/file\\"]"], "workdir": "..."}
      \`\`\`

      **Tips & Details:**
      - **\`-test-files\` argument:** Pass a JSON-encoded array of paths to test files. If you omit it, the script will exit with a usage error.
      - **Error handling:** Also uses \`set -e\`. On any test failure, it prints ‚Äúüí• SOME TESTS FAILED!‚Äù and exits with status 1.
      - **Logs:** Complete test output is written to \`/tmp/test_output.txt\`. Review this log to see passed/failed test counts and failure details.
      - **Success criteria:** After running tests, the script reports the number of failed tests; zero failures prints ‚Äúüéâ ALL TESTS PASSED!‚Äù.
